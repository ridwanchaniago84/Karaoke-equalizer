# Karaoke-equalizer
Karaoke equalizer is an automation for Aegisub, this automation can equalize karaoke syls between lines.
## How it works
This automation copies the karaoke time from the first selected line to the next, if the next line has a different number of syls, start time, or end time, the automation will turn the different line into a benchmark for the next line.
## Installation
Copy zankenzu.KaraokeEqualizer.lua to `yourAegisubFolder/automation/autoload/`
